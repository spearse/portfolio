# Stephen Pearse — CV (November 2025)

## Profile
Audio/AI engineer and former academic with 13+ years building tools for music creators. Led cross-platform DAWs, AI arrangement systems, semantic audio search, and payments platforms. Comfortable owning architecture, delivery, and team patterns from research prototypes through production releases.

## Core Skills
- **Audio/DSP:** C++/JUCE, Qt/PyQt, <10ms real-time pipelines, LUFS/EBU R128, filters/effects, hardware integration (CDJ/ASIO/CoreAudio), cross-platform delivery.
  - Real-time patterns and optimization for pro audio UX.
- **AI/ML systems:** LLM integration (Vertex/Gemini), semantic search (MERT, CLaMP3, FAISS), streaming parsers/DSLs for musical structure, PyTorch/Transformers.
  - Streaming/embedding pipelines and semantic alignment for production use.
- **Full-stack/infra:** TypeScript (NestJS, React, TypeORM), Python/FastAPI, Chargebee/webhooks, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, signing/notarization, Windows installers), Docker/GCP, feature flags/observability (ConfigCat, Sentry).
  - Delivery, rollout control, and operational hygiene for product teams.
- **Leadership:** Tech lead, interviewer, onboarding/patterns, cross-functional collaboration with ML/backend/product, rapid delivery under tight timelines.

## Experience
**Density (Audio/AI tools)** — Lead Software Engineer / Tech Lead / AI Design Lead (2021–Present)  
- **Cross-platform DAW:** Led Mac-only → Mac/Windows port; reworked threading/interop; built Windows CI/CD; universal binaries/signing; crash rate down 40% (5%→3%); release cadence from monthly to ~1.5 weeks; supported ~2,500 DAU.  
- **Real-time audio/DSP:** Lock-free messaging, preallocated buffers, LUFS metering (BS.1770-4), filter modeling, fractional delay/multi-band limiting, hardware recording from CDJs.  
- **AI Copilot:** Architected LLM-driven arrangement assistant (PyQt desktop, DensityMark DSL with streaming parser, resilient DAW connections); delivered semantic search pipeline (MERT→CLaMP3, FAISS) in <1 month; VC demo driver; pro DJ testers.  
- **CLaMP3 semantic search:** Sub-100ms text/audio/hybrid search over 10K+ files; dual deployment (local vs. GCP GPU) with 15–30× speedup via batching/model reuse.  
- **Web platform/payments:** Built rent-to-own/perpetual payments (NestJS/React/Chargebee) in ~2 months; backward-compatible with legacy subs; zero production billing issues; discount engine with precedence rules and price floors.  
- **Team:** Interviewer/onboarding; established patterns for cross-platform code, rollout controls, and testing across desktop and services.

**Pearse Audio Consultancy** — Director/Consultant (2022–2023)  
Contracted by Density for DSP architecture, real-time audio processing, and software design on the DAW.

**University of Portsmouth, School of Creative Technologies** — Senior Lecturer, Computational Sound (2011–2020)  
Led music computing research group and MSc program; taught C++ audio development and spatial audio; supervised PhDs. Built EU-funded **Compose with Sounds** pedagogical DAW (solo dev, 7 years): custom C++/Qt engine, 10 languages, Mac/Win/Linux deployment in European schools; ADC 2019 talk and SMC 2019 paper.

## Selected Projects
- **Density Copilot:** AI music arrangement assistant; DSL + streaming parser; semantic search; multi-DAW integration; key fundraising differentiator.  
- **Density DAW:** Pro DJ DAW; cross-platform port; reliability/observability; real-time DSP; hardware integration; ~2,500 DAU.  
- **CLaMP3 Audio Semantic Search:** Research-to-prod ML pipeline in <1 month; MERT→CLaMP3 embeddings; FAISS; dual deployment; sub-100ms queries.  
- **Density Web Platform (RTO/Payments):** Full-stack licensing shift (one-time and $15×14 rent-to-own); Chargebee webhooks with locking; React flows; zero billing incidents.  
- **Compose with Sounds:** EU Commission–funded educational DAW; 10-language i18n; cross-platform; curriculum-aligned materials.

## Education
- **PhD, Music Technology** — University of Sheffield (2017)  
  Thesis: “Agent-Based Graphic Sound Synthesis and Acousmatic Composition”
- **BMus** — University of Sheffield (2010)

## Publications & Talks (selected)
- “No tracks or graphs? Designing sound-based educational audio workstations” — Audio Developer Conference (ADC), 2019 (talk).
- “Composing with Sounds: Designing an Object-Oriented DAW for the teaching of Sound-Based Composition” — Sound and Music Computing Conference, 2019.
