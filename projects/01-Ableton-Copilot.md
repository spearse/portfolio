# Project: Ableton Copilot - AI-Powered DAW Automation & Music Composition System

## Summary

Developed an intelligent automation platform that bridges Ableton Live with generative AI to revolutionize music production workflows. The system enables musicians to leverage AI for context-aware MIDI composition, semantic audio search using natural language, and automated arrangement creation. Built with a Python remote script integration for Ableton Live, a PyQt5 desktop interface, and backend API connections to Google Gemini 2.0 Flash and Vertex AI. Musicians can describe sounds in natural language to search audio libraries, generate harmonically-aware bass lines and melodies that complement existing musical context, and automate complex arrangement workflows using a custom markup language. The platform also supports cross-DAW interoperability by exporting Ableton arrangements to other DAW formats while preserving timing, audio files, and clip metadata. Additionally implemented ML model fine-tuning capabilities using reinforcement learning to improve music generation quality over time.

## CV Bullets

- Engineered an AI-powered music composition system that integrates Google Gemini 2.0 Flash with Ableton Live, enabling musicians to generate harmonically-aware MIDI parts based on existing musical context through natural language prompts and automated validation

- Developed a semantic audio analysis pipeline using Vertex AI that processes audio files concurrently, allowing musicians to search sound libraries using natural language descriptions and automatically generate musical metadata

- Built cross-platform DAW automation tools including socket-based remote script architecture, PyQt5 desktop application, and automated export workflows that preserve musical timing and audio integrity across different music production software

- Designed a custom markup language for musical arrangements that enables reproducible workflows, clip palette management, and declarative composition specifications for automated arrangement generation

- Implemented reinforcement learning pipelines for fine-tuning music generation models using reward-based optimization, improving the quality and musical coherence of AI-generated compositions

## Tagline

AI-enhanced music production platform connecting Ableton Live with Google Gemini and Vertex AI for intelligent composition, semantic audio search, and automated arrangement workflows.

## Architecture Overview

The system uses a multi-tier architecture where a Python remote script runs inside Ableton Live, providing real-time access to DAW functionality through a socket-based API. A PyQt5 desktop application serves as the user interface, managing workflow orchestration between the DAW and cloud-based AI services. For composition tasks, the system extracts musical context from Live sessions, sends it to Google Gemini with specialized music theory prompts, validates the AI-generated output through multiple stages, and executes the results back in the DAW. Audio analysis workflows leverage Vertex AI's parallel processing capabilities to generate semantic descriptions of audio files that enable natural language search. The platform supports bidirectional data flow: users can export arrangements from Live to other DAW formats with automated file management and metadata preservation, or import AI-generated compositions directly into their sessions. ML training components operate independently through cloud infrastructure, using reinforcement learning to continuously improve model performance based on musical quality metrics.
