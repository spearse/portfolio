# Compose with Sounds v2
Role: Sole Developer (2013–2020, ~1,500 hours) • Funding: EU Commission grant • Reach: European schools, 10 languages • Platforms: macOS/Windows/Linux

## Overview
Built a pedagogical DAW for electroacoustic/experimental music where sound objects—not notation—are the primary unit. Shipped cross-platform with a custom C++ audio engine (FSOM) and Qt UI, translated into 10 languages for European deployment.

Built a pedagogical DAW for sound-based composition: custom C++ FSOM engine, Qt UI with visualizations, translated into 10 languages, and deployed across European schools. Solo-developed over ~1,500 hours alongside a senior lecturer role.

## Impact
EU Commission–funded; enabled learners without notation literacy to compose with sound objects; sustained deployment across multiple countries; talks/papers at ADC and SMC 2019.

## How it works
- Engine/UI: FSOM real-time engine with non-destructive editing; Qt drag-and-drop UI and 3D/animated visualizations to make abstract concepts tangible.
- Internationalization: 10-language support via Qt i18n with educator-aligned terminology.
- Curriculum: Workflows, materials, and teacher training tailored to classroom use.
- Cross-platform: Installers for Mac/Win/Linux; tested for stability in varied school environments.

## Challenges
- Long-term solo maintenance → disciplined architecture, documentation, and version control.
- Cross-platform audio quirks → abstraction layer plus extensive testing/fallbacks.
- Balancing power vs. approachability → guided workflows, sensible defaults, visual scaffolding.
