## Career Journey

<div class="highlight-box" markdown="1">

### 🎓 Academic Foundation (2011-2020)

After completing my **PhD in music computing** focused on agentic tools for experimental music composition, I spent 9 years as **Senior Lecturer at the University of Portsmouth**.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Led the music computing research group
- Directed the MSc Music & Sound Technology program
- Secured EU Commission funding for educational technology
- Built Compose with Sounds v2 as sole developer over 7 years

**Compose with Sounds** was a pedagogical digital audio workstation enabling students to compose with sound objects. Built in C++ with Qt framework, it featured custom audio engine, 3D visualizations, 10 language translations, and cross-platform support. Deployed across European schools with comprehensive curriculum materials.

### 🚀 Industry Transition (2020-2021)

After 9 years building educational tools, I wanted to create systems for professional artists. I joined **Density** as a software engineer working on their professional DJ/DAW application.

**Key Learnings:**
- Production engineering vs. academic prototypes (reliability, scale, user support)
- Commercial software development (CI/CD, monitoring, crash tracking)
- Team collaboration and fast iteration cycles
- Business context (revenue, users, market fit, product roadmap)

</div>

<div class="highlight-box" markdown="1">

### 👨‍💼 Technical Leadership (2021-2023)

**Promoted to Tech Lead** after 1.5 years based on technical contributions and cross-platform expertise.

**Major Achievements:**
- **Cross-platform transformation** - Led Mac-only → Windows+Mac migration
- **Reliability improvements** - Reduced crash rate 40% (5% → 3%)
- **Release velocity** - Accelerated releases 6× faster (monthly → every 1.5 weeks)
- **Real-time audio** - Implemented <10ms latency processing with lock-free queues
- **Professional DSP** - ITU-R BS.1770-4 LUFS metering, filter modeling, effects processing
- **Hardware integration** - CDJ equipment recording via custom Java/C++ interop
- **Team building** - Lead technical interviewer, developed onboarding program

**Scale:** Supporting **2,500 daily active users** at major festivals including **Burning Man** and **EDC Las Vegas**.

### 🤖 AI/ML Systems (2023-Present)

As Density invested in LLM-powered music production tools, I pivoted to lead **Copilot**, an AI music production assistant generating professional arrangements from natural language.

**Design Leadership:**
- Architected complete system (PyQt5 desktop app integrating Google Gemini LLM)
- Designed custom DSL (DensityMark) bridging LLMs and musical structure with streaming parser
- Built semantic audio search in <1 month (MERT→Clamp3 embeddings, FAISS vector search)
- Multi-DAW integration (Socket-based IPC with Ableton Live, extensible to Density DAW)
- Coordinated cross-functional teams (Backend engineers, ML engineers, product team)
- 100+ comprehensive tests (Unit, integration, and regression coverage)

**Business Impact:**
- Shipped to multiple VCs driving "heavy investment" interest
- Professional DJ validation in real-world production workflows
- Cited as key differentiator for fundraising
