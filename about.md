# About Me
I'm Stephen Pearse — audio/AI engineer and former academic who builds tools for music creators. I’ve led cross-platform DAWs, AI arrangement systems, semantic search, and payments platforms, pairing real-time audio chops with production engineering.

## Current Focus
At Density I lead and architect audio/AI systems: an LLM-driven arrangement assistant (Copilot), a semantic search pipeline (MERT→CLaMP3, FAISS), a cross-platform pro DJ DAW, and a rent-to-own/payments platform. My work blends real-time constraints, production observability, and fast release cycles.

## Foundation
I spent nine years in academia (PhD in music computing; Senior Lecturer) leading a music computing research group and MSc program. During that time I built **Compose with Sounds**, an EU-funded pedagogical DAW: custom C++/Qt engine, 10 languages, Mac/Win/Linux, deployed in European schools, with talks at ADC and SMC 2019.

    <h4>What I’m good at</h4>
    <p>Real-time audio/DSP (C++/JUCE/Qt, <10ms paths), LLM + semantic search integrations, and building production pipelines that ship fast without breaking.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-box">
    <h4>How I lead</h4>
    <p>Hands-on architecture with clear patterns, mentoring/interviewing, and cross-functional alignment with ML/backend/product to deliver under tight timelines.</p>
